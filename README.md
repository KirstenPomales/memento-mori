## Overview

### What happens to your crypto when you die? 

It’s tough to think about death, but it’s essential to plan for your future. 

Thats why were building Memento Mori: a concept in philosophy - a reminder that we’re all mortal, and will die.

**Existing will and recovery options in crypto are flawed:**

- Require using a centralized intermediary to send crypto to your heirs
- Split your private keys across multiple people: creates a stalemate where heirs are incentivized to not share their part of the private key before another

**We need a system that is structured like traditional trusts: something proven for nearly a thousand years.** 

- If person found still alive, ownership is kept
    - Funds not transferred to heirs,  rather held in the trust
- Person can configure how trust is used - not blindly giving money to hairs
    - ZK verification of what funds are used on
    - timed release of funds (like standard trust)
